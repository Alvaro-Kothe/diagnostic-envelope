# Diagnostic Analysis for Rate Models

This is the source code for our paper about diagnostic analysis for rate models.

## Generate Figures

To generate the figures, execute the following commands:

```bash
make requirements
make visualization
```

This setups the R environment with the necessary packages and create all the figures for the article.

If you don't have `make` in your system, you may execute the file [R/main.R](./R/main.R) within Rstudio.
Read the commented code at the top of the file on how to install the necessary package versions.
